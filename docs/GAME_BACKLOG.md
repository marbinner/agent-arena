# Planned Games

This document lists candidate games for future implementation. The goal is to cover a wide range of reasoning and planning capabilities.

## Board Strategy
- **Checkers** – classic 8x8 draughts game.
- **Chess (mini variant)** – simplified board for long-term planning.
- **Gomoku** – five in a row on a 15x15 board.
- **Othello** – flipping pieces to control territory.
- **Dots and Boxes** – claiming edges to complete squares.
- **Hex** – path connection game on a rhombus board. (implemented)
- **Dots and Boxes** – claiming edges to complete squares. (implemented)
- **Mancala** – resource sowing and capture.
- **Quoridor** – race to the opposite side while placing walls. (implemented)
- **Ultimate TicTacToe** – tic-tac-toe boards inside a larger grid.

## Word and Deduction
- **Word Ladder Duel** – players alternately change one letter to reach a goal word. (implemented)
- **Hangman** – guess the hidden word one letter at a time.
- **Mastermind** – code-breaking with feedback.

## Mathematical Puzzles
- **Multi-heap Nim** – generalization of the existing single-heap Nim.
- **Sudoku Race** – players take turns filling numbers on a shared grid.

These games span pure strategy, deduction, memory, and arithmetic reasoning.
